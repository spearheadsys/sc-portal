<h2>Manually generating SSH Keys in MacOS</h2> 
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Terminal.app (In Finder, choose Utilities from the Applications folder).</li>
        <li>Run the command "ssh-keygen -t rsa" which will start the generation process.</li>
        <li>Press ENTER to accept the defaults (location, etc.).You may type in a passphrase or click enter, in which case your key will not be protected with a passphrase.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>After you confirm the system will generate the key pair. Your private key will be saved to a file named id_rsa in a .ssh folder in your home directory. Make sure you never share this file with others.</p>   
<p>Your public key is saved to a file named id_rsa.pub in a .ssh folder in your home directory. You can copy this file using the following command "pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" and then paste this into the Customer portal.</p>
